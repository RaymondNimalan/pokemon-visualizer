## Brief Description:

I built the Pokémon visualizer app using Next.js for its ability to handle both server and client-side rendering efficiently. By running all data fetches on the server-side, I minimized load times by pre-loading data for faster performance and better SEO. I used Chart.js to visualize Pokémon stats in dynamic charts, making the data engaging and easy to interpret.

I utlized Tailwind CSS and React.js to create a responsive design that adapts well across different screen sizes. The result is a fast, responsive, and user-friendly app optimized for performance and interactivity.
